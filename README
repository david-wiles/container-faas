container-paas

This is a simple platform that allows users to run apps started with a simple HTTP request. The apps must
be pre-built on the server, but the user may enter any starting command.

To start the server without the nginx reverse proxy:
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 --network app-network --rm paas-server

With nginx:
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --env-file .env -p 8080:80 -p 5000-6000:5000-6000/tcp --network app-network --rm paas-server-nginx

/admin/<app id>
    GET - get data about this app
    POST - create a new app or update an existing one
        request body: application/json
        {
            "image": string, - the name of the image to use
            "cmd": string, - start command
            "dir": string, - directory to mount. Must exist on the server
            "env": [string] - list of environment variables to pass to the app, in the form KEY=VAL
        }

    DELETE - deletes the app

/app/<app id>
    * - inform the server that this app has received a request and route the request to the app. Upon receiving
        a response, we route it back to the user

/health/<app id>
    GET - informs the server that the specified app is running. Should not be used by any client other than
           the app itself
