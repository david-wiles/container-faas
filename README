vlab-faas-server manages the state of various docker containers currently running student's programs. There are a few
constraints which the server must follow...

* The student's files are stored on a separate volume, which must be mounted to each container to run.
* Each container should listen on a unique port. An nginx reverse proxy will route requests to each container.
* The containers should not have to restart for a student to see their changes
* A container may see lots of activity for a short period of time (a class period), but then may not be used for a long time.
  We may want to evict containers after a certain period of time, and pull from a private registry whenever the container
  is needed again.
* The student should not need to interact with any system configuration. While we may want to allow the student to ssh
  into a container (future), all they will need to do is tell the server what command should be used to start their program.

To start the server without the nginx reverse proxy:
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 --network app-network --name vlab vlab-server


/
    GET - get server information

/admin/<container id>
    GET - get data about this container
    POST - create a new container or update an existing one
    DELETE - deletes the container

/container/<container id>
    * - inform the server that this container has received a request and route the request to the container. Upon receiving
        a response, we route it back to the user

/health/<container id>
    GET - informs the server that the specified container is running. Should not be used by any client other than
           the container itself
